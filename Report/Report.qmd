# Bechdel Test

## Executive Summary

In this project, I explore the varying factors including:

-   Genre

-   Rating

-   Country of Origin

-   Budget

-   Year

-   Guidance rating

-   Gross

Particularly, I explore the impacts these factor may have on whether or not a movie passes or fails the Bechdel Test. Using predictive modeling and exploratory analystical methods, we do not find substantial evidence that any of these factors have a significant role in whether or not a movie passes the test.

## Background

The Bechdel test is a test used to test gender biases and representation of women in movies, TV shows, etc. Often women in film portray characters that lack depth or are depicted as certain archetypes of damsels in distress. The test was first introduced by cartoonist Alison Bechdel who said that in order to pass the test a work of fiction must:

-   Involve two named women characters

-   The two women must converse with one another

-   The conversation does not involve a man or any mention of a male character.

Many movies fail to pass this test and it highlights the need for more female representation in strong roles beyond male-centric themes.

## Initial Research Question

I would like to know the impact that certain predictor variables have on whether or not a movie will pass the Bechdel Test. More specifically, for example, if movies that fall under the action genre are more likely to pass/fail the Bechdel Test or if movies that have have higher overall ratings are more likely to pass/fail the Bechdel Test. I take these further and explore other varying factors as well.

## Data Collection and Documentation

### Bechdel Test Data

The data is from a public data source call [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-03-09/readme.md) and it was created by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bechdel), a polling aggregation website using [Bechdel](https://bechdeltest.com/) test data which analyzed over 5,000 films and whether or not they passed the test alongside [TheNumbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/) which compiled a dataset of various stats on the different movies including awards, directors, ratings, revenue, etc. The data was collected to expose gender biases within film and compare whether or not those films that pass or do not pass the Bechdel test differ in budgets, ratings, revenue, etc. The set analyzes 1,794 films between the years of 1970-2013. The films in the dataset are an aggregate of the intersection between the films in the Numbers data set and the Bechdel dataset.

### Raw Bechdel Data:

The Raw Bechdel data set contains 10,136 observations. Each row of the Raw Bechdel data set is a movie which contains the following 5 columns:

-   A Movie ID

-   The year it was made

-   The IMDB ID which is an ID assigned to each movie by the Internet Movie Database

-   The title of the movie

-   A Rating which is a scale of 0-3:

    -   1 means the movies features at least 2 named women.

    -   2 means that the women converse with one another

    -   3 means that the conversation is about something other than a man.

    -   0 means the movie is un-scored or contains none of the Bechdel features.

Below is a preview of the dataset:

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-Raw-Bechdel 
#| tbl-cap: A few rows of the movies data-set
library(gridExtra)

raw_bechdel %>%   
  head(5) %>%   
  kable()



```

### Movies Data:

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-Movies 
#| tbl-cap: A few rows of the movies data-set
library(gridExtra)

columns_to_exclude <- c("plot", "clean_test", "test")

subset_movies <-
  movies[, !(names(movies) %in% columns_to_exclude)]

subset_movies %>%   
  head(5) %>%   
  kable()

```

The Movies data set contains 1,794 observations. The data set is the the product of an intersection between the raw bechdel data set (every movie that has been put through the Bechdel test by the Bechdel website) and the data set from the [Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) website which is a congregated data set of every movie to hit the box office and their various characteristics.

## Exploratory Analysis and Observations

### Potential Response Variables

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
#| label: fig-1
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Exploratory plot for the number of movies that passed and fail the Bechdel Test.


ra_1 <- movies  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=binary, fill=binary)) + 
  geom_bar(color="#512d6d") + 
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightpink","lightblue")) + 
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = after_stat(count), vjust = 3), size = 4)
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  xlab("Passing or Failing Bechdel Test") + 
  ylab("Count") +
     theme(legend.position = "none")


ra_1 



```

We can see in the data-set, there are more movies that fail the Bechdel Test than pass. There are 991 failing movies as opposed to 803 passing movies.

#### Year

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| message: false

summary_data <- movies %>%
  group_by(year, binary) %>%
  summarise(count = n())


years_with_more_passing <- summary_data %>%
  spread(binary, count, fill = 0) %>%  
  filter(PASS > FAIL)  


cat("Years with more passing movies than failing movies:\n")
cat(years_with_more_passing$year, sep = "\n")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
#| label: fig-2
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Exploratory stacked bar plot of the distribution of movies that passed and failed the Bechdel Test over the years.
figure <- ggplot(movies, aes(x=year, fill=binary)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightpink","lightblue")) +
  labs(
    fill="Bechdel Test Outcome"
  )


ggsave("Data Science/simal_bechdel_test/Figures/pf_year_dist.png", plot = figure, width = 8, height = 6)

figure

```

Figure two displays the distribution of movies produced over the years sorted by whether or not they pass the Bechdel Test. Over the years the proportions of pass to fail seem to be roughly the same from year-to-year. As seen in the chart above, the listed years are those in we saw more passing than failing movies. Evidently, there are more failing years than passing but the counts of the years are not too substantial.

#### 

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
movies_sorted_genre <- movies %>%
  separate_rows(genre, sep = ", ")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
movies_pass<- movies %>%
  filter(binary == "PASS")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
movies_fail <- movies %>%
  filter(binary == "FAIL")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
#| label: fig-3
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Line plots of the count of movies passing and failing over the years.
pass<- ggplot(movies_pass, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(stat = "count", color = "lightblue") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Count of Movies Passing") +
  theme_minimal()

fail<- ggplot(movies_fail, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(stat = "count", color = "lightpink") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Count of Movies Failing") +
  theme_minimal()

(pass + fail)
```

As evident in the plot, the rate of both passing and failing moves saw an initial steady increase since the 1970s with varying peaks and lows throughout the years, but there has been a more signifigant decline since 2010. However, we can see a slightly growing increase as of recent for both.

#### Genre

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| message: false

summary_data <- movies_sorted_genre %>%
  group_by(genre, binary) %>%
  summarise(count = n())


genres_with_more_passing <- summary_data %>%
  spread(binary, count, fill = 0) %>%  
  filter(PASS > FAIL)  


cat("Genres with more passing movies than failing movies:\n")
cat(genres_with_more_passing$genre, sep = "\n")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

movies_sorted_country<- movies %>%
  separate_rows(country, sep = ", ")


```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

#| label: fig-4
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Stacked bar plot of the distribution of movies that passed and failed by genre.


movies_sorted_genre %>%
  group_by(genre, binary) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, y = count, fill= binary)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
 scale_fill_manual(values = c("PASS" = "lightblue", "FAIL" = "lightpink")) +
  
  xlab("Genre") +
  ylab("Count") +
   theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

This plot displays the counts of passing and failing movies sorted by genre. In the chart listed you can see the movies that have more passing movies than failing.

#### Parental Guidance Rating

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| message: false

summary_data <- movies %>%
  group_by(rated, binary) %>%
  summarise(count = n())


rating_with_more_failing<- summary_data %>%
  spread(binary, count, fill = 0) %>%  
  filter(PASS < FAIL)  


cat("Ratings with more failing movies than passing movies:\n")
cat(rating_with_more_failing$rated, sep = "\n")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
#| label: fig-5
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Grouped bar plot of the count of movies passing and failing grouped by guidance rating.
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rated, fill = binary)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  xlab("Guidance Rating") +
  ylab("Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("PASS" = "lightblue", "FAIL" = "lightpink")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

This plot does the same function as the previous, but sorts based on the parental guidance rating. 10 of the 12 ratings all fail more than passing.

#### Country of Origin

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

movies_sorted_country<- movies %>%
  separate_rows(country, sep = ", ")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| message: false

summary_data <- movies_sorted_country %>%
  group_by(country, binary) %>%
  summarise(count = n())


country_with_more_failing <- summary_data %>%
  spread(binary, count, fill = 0) %>%  
  filter(PASS < FAIL)  


cat("Countries with more failing movies than passing movies:\n")
cat(country_with_more_failing$country, sep = "\n")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

top_countries <- movies_sorted_country %>%
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(movie_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(movie_count)) %>%
  head(5)
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#| label: fig-6
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: The top 5 producers of movies in the dataset and their proportion of failing/passing movies.

countries_of_interest <- c("USA", "UK", "Germany", "France", "Canada")

filtered_data <- movies_sorted_country %>%
  filter(country %in% countries_of_interest)

ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = country, fill = binary)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  xlab("Country") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("PASS" = "lightblue", "FAIL" = "lightpink")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

This plot displays the proportion of failures to passes for the top 5 producers of movies in the industry. They are roughly the same with some producing slightly more failures than passes and vice versa. The chart above lists the countries with more failing movies than passing overall.

#### Gross

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
#| label: fig-7
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Grouped bar plot of the count of movies passing and failing grouped by guidance rating.
movies %>%
  filter(year >= 1990) %>%
  arrange(desc(intgross_2013)) %>%
  select(title, budget, intgross, intgross_2013, binary) %>%
  head(25) %>% 
  mutate(title = fct_reorder(title, intgross_2013)) %>%
ggplot(aes(intgross_2013, title, fill= binary)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("PASS" = "lightblue", "FAIL" = "lightpink")) +
  geom_col()



```

This grouped bar plot displays top 25 movies with the most produced international gross and whether they passed or failed the Bechdel test. More top earners failed than passed.

#### Budget

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
#| label: fig-8
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Box plot of the distribution of movie ratings of those that passed and failed with outliers, means, and quartiles
 movies_sorted_genre %>%
  mutate(movies = fct_reorder(genre, budget)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(budget, genre, fill = binary, color = binary)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single"), alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("PASS" = "lightblue", "FAIL" = "lightpink")) +
  labs(y = NULL, color = NULL, fill = NULL, x = "Budget")
 
 
```

The average budgets for each genre fall between \$10,000,000 and \$100,000,000 and these were sorted by which genres failed and passed more.

#### Rating

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
#| label: fig-9
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: Box plot of the distribution of movie ratings of those that passed and failed with outliers, means, and quartiles

ggplot(movies, aes(x = binary, y = imdb_rating)) +
  labs(x = "Bechdel Test Outcome",
       y = "IMDB Rating") + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()




```

The ratings of the movies in relation to passes and failures do not seem to have any sort of impact on whether a movie passes or fails. The average rating for both fell between 6 and 8.

)

  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Confidence Intervals for Model Coefficients") +
  coord_flip()

```

## Model Results

Figures 10 and 11 shows the bootstrap estimates for the linear regression coefficients for the predictors of budget/revenue and genre/ratings respectively along with estimates for the 95% confidence intervals. Since the confidence intervals for all predictors include 0, we cannot conclude that there is a relationship between these variables and passing or failing the Bechdel Test.

## Conclusions

In this report, we analyzed various predictor variables and their impact on the outcome of the Bechdel test performed on each movie. There is little evidence to suggest that there is a significant relationship between these factors and test outcomes.

To further improve our analysis, we could analyze more movies especially more recent ones. It would also be interesting if there was data included on the gender of each director. I could also consider utilizing other predictive modeling such as decision trees or support vector machines that could provide more accuracy.
