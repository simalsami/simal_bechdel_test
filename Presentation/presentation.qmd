## Initial Research Question

-   The Bechdel Test is a test used to evaluate gender biases within media specifically in terms of the portrayl of women. In order to pass the test a film or other work of fiction must satisfy three conditions:

    -   The work must feature two women.

    -   The women must hold a conversation with one another.

    -   The conversation must concern something other than a man.

-   **I would like to know what factors specifically genre, budget, revenue, year, country, gross, ratings, etc. have an impact on whether a movie passes or fails the test.**

## Raw Bechdel Data

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-Raw-Bechdel
#| tbl-cap: A few rows of the Raw Bechdel Data set

library(gridExtra)

raw_bechdel %>%   
  head(5) %>%   
  kable()
```

# Movies Data

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-Movies 
#| tbl-cap: A few rows of the movies data-set
library(gridExtra)

columns_to_exclude <- c("plot", "clean_test", "test")

subset_movies <-
  movies[, !(names(movies) %in% columns_to_exclude)]

subset_movies %>%   
  head(5) %>%   
  kable()
```

# Conclusions

-   We lack evidence that predictor variables like genre, budget, revenue, year, country, gross, and rating have a significant impact on whether a movie passes the Bechdel Test.

-   Guidance ratings may have a slight impact in that ratings like PG, PG-13, and R tend to have more failing than passing movies.
